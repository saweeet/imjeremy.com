## Quote of the day

"Without **love**, deeds, even the most brilliant, count as nothing"  <br />~ St Thérèse de Lisieux


 
#### **Reflection** 
Amen Saint Terese! Indeed without love, our great deeds and accomplishments are nothing. Please pray that I will remember to do all things the same love that Jesus gives me each day. Help me also recall that all good comes from Jesus Christ himself. I can do nothing without Him.
