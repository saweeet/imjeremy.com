### Hey!

What's up world ?!

I'm Jeremy - A devout Catholic that is currently working as an Cloud Support Engineer and so yes, that means I work on fluffy white pillows in the sky. This site currently serves as a variety of content that I'm interested in and passionate about. I use it as a playground for many of the technologies I find myself tinkering with. Don't be surprised if I blow this up and revive it every so often.

I love visiting the Blessed Sacrament, playing classical guitar, chess, playing computer games with my most beautful wife, long walks on the beach, etc.

Feel free to reach out.
