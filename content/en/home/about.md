### Hey!

What's up, world?!

I'm Jeremy, a devout Catholic husband currently working as a Cloud Support Engineer. And yes, that means working on fluffy white pillows in the sky.

This site serves as a space for a variety of content that I'm interested in and passionate about. I use it as a playground for many of the technologies I enjoy tinkering with. I expect this site to undergo some wear and tear, be pulled apart, and then revived every so often.

I love visiting Holy Hour, spending time with my beautiful wife, playing classical guitar, chess, computer games, taking long walks on the beach, and more.
