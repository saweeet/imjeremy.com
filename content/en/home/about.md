### Hey!

What's up world ?!

I'm Jeremy, a devout Catholic Husband that is currently working as an Cloud Support Engineer and  yes, that means working on fluffy white pillows in the sky. 

This site currently serves as a variety of content that I'm interested in and passionate about. I use it as a playground for many of the technologies I find myself tinkering with. I expect this site to suffer, be pulled apart and then revived every so often

I love visiting the spending time with my most beautiful wife, playing classical guitar, chess,  computer games, long walks on the beach, etc.
