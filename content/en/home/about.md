### Hey!

What's up world ?!

I'm Jeremy - A devout Catholic that is currently working as an Cloud Support Engineer for AWS. This site currently serves as a variety of content that I'm interested in and passionate about. I use it as a playground for many of the technologies I find myself tinkering with. Don't be surprised if I blow this up and revive it every so often.

I love visiting the Blessed Sacrament, playing classical guitar, chess, playing Overwatch with my beloved wife, long walks on the beach, etc.

Feel free to reach out using any of the social media platforms listed below.
