Remember O Most Gracious Virgin Mary, that never was it known that anyone who fled unto Thy protection, implored Thy help or sought Thine intercession, was left unaided by Thee. Inspired by this confidence I fly onto Thee, O Virgin of virgins, my Mother. To Thee I come, before Thee I stand, sinful and sorrowful. Do not, O Mother of the Word Incarnate, despise my petitions but, in Thy clemency, hear and answer me.

Amen.
