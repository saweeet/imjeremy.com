I’m no expert in any of the topics mentioned here, nor am I a theologian.  Working within the I.T. realm, I do not many conversations to exercise my faith through theology. This blog intends to help explain my understanding to myself and to others of various topics including reasons of faith and morals. 

Christians are called to evangelise our faith and set the world ablaze,  *"Be who God meant you to be and you will set the world on fire"* - St. Catherine of Siena. 

These pages will simply allow me to share my own journey of faith and put understanding into writing. You are not going to find all the answers here. This is just where I’m at with my faith and level of understanding. 

Also, be sure to check out my **[Prayers](/prayers)** section if you're interested.

God bless and Peace out.
