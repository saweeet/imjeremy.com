I’m no expert in any of the topics mentioned here, nor am I a theologian.  I work in the I.T. industry and I use this blog to help explain to myself and to others, reasons of faith and morals. As Christians, we are called to evanglize our faith and set the world ablaze.  If I can’t explain it here, then how am I supposed to share my faith to others ? So ultimately this is just good practice for me. I can ensure you that you’re not going to find all the answers here. This is just where I’m at with my faith and level of understanding.

God bless and Peace out.
