I’m no expert in any of the topics mentioned here, nor am I a theologian.  I work in the I.T. space so this blog is intended to help explain to myself and to others, reasons of faith and morals. As you probably know, Christians  are called to evanglize our faith and set the world ablaze. These pages will be to simply put my own journey of faith and understanding into writing. I can ensure you that you’re not going to find all the answers here. This is just where I’m at with my faith and level of understanding.

Also, be sure to check out my [Prayers](/prayers) section if you're interested

God bless and Peace out.
