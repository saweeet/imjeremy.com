> Christians are called to evangelise our faith and set the world ablaze.  *"Be who God meant you to be and you will set the world on fire"* - St. Catherine of Siena. 

These page intends to help explain my understanding of my faith to myself, and to others of various topics including reasons of faith and morals. By all means, I’m no expert in any of the topics mentioned here, nor am I a theologian. I pray that these posts will allow me to serve and accompany my own journey of faith by putting my understanding into writing. You are not going to find all the answers here. Heck, I might actually invoke more questions than answers. This is just where I’m at with my level of understanding. 

In my posts, I divided my thoughts into two sections, quick thoughts and longer ones. The first being my initial thoughts when conversing on this topic. Perhaps useful if I know I'm about to engage discussion. The longer ones for a deep dive.

Be sure to check out my **[Prayers](/prayers)** section if you're interested.

God bless and Peace out.
