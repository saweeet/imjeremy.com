Images can be added to posts using Markdown syntax:

```md
![Sample image](workday.jpg)
```

Which looks like this:

![Sample image](/images/workday.jpg)

You can also use Hugo's built-in [figure shortcode](/images/workday.jpg). This lets you add a caption, and looks like this:

{{< figure src="/images/workday.jpg" title="Black and white work day photo." >}}

Posts with images are great at capturing attention and showcasing your work. Why not try it today?
