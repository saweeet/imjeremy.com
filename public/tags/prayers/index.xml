      <description>The Angelus has been traditionally said three times daily, at 6 am, noon and 6 pm&#xA;V. The Angel of the Lord declared unto Mary, R. And she conceived of the Holy Spirit.&#xA;Hail Mary, etc&amp;hellip;&#xA;V. Behold the handmaid of the Lord. R. Be it done unto me according to Your Word.&#xA;Hail Mary, etc&amp;hellip;&#xA;V. And the Word was made flesh, (all bow or genuflect as these words are spoken) R.</description>

      <description>I believe in God, the Father Almighty, Creator of Heaven and earth; and in Jesus Christ, His only Son, Our Lord, Who was conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified; died, and was buried. He descended into Hell; the third day He arose again from the dead; He ascended into Heaven, sitteth at the right hand of God, the Father Almighty; from thence He shall come to judge the living and the dead.</description>

      <description>I confess to almighty God and to you, my brothers and sisters, that I have greatly sinned in my thoughts and in my words, in what I have done, and in what I have failed to do; through my fault, through my fault, through my most grievous fault; therefore I ask blessed Mary ever-Virgin, all the Angels and Saints, and you, my brothers and sisters, to pray for me to the Lord our God.</description>

Lord Jesus Christ, only Son of the Father, Lord God, Lamb of God, you take away the sin of the world: have mercy on us; you are seated at the right hand of the Father: receive our prayer.</description>

      <description>Hail, holy Queen, Mother of Mercy! our life, our sweetness, and our hope! To thee do we cry, poor banished children of Eve; to thee do we send up our sighs, mourning and weeping in this valley, of tears. Turn, then, most gracious Advocate, thine eyes of mercy toward us; and after this our exile show unto us the blessed fruit of thy womb, Jesus; O clement, O loving, O sweet Virgin Mary.</description>

      <description>The first set of petitions in the Litany of Humility requests our deliverance from desiring validation from man instead of God.&#xA;O Jesus! meek and humble of heart, Hear me. Response for the following: Deliver me, Jesus. From the desire of being esteemed … From the desire of being loved … From the desire of being extolled … From the desire of being honored … From the desire of being praised … From the desire of being preferred to others… From the desire of being consulted … From the desire of being approved … The second set of petitions address our fears that are related to pride.</description>

      <description>Remember O Most Gracious Virgin Mary, that never was it known that anyone who fled unto Thy protection, implored Thy help or sought Thine intercession, was left unaided by Thee. Inspired by this confidence I fly onto Thee, O Virgin of virgins, my Mother. To Thee I come, before Thee I stand, sinful and sorrowful. Do not, O Mother of the Word Incarnate, despise my petitions but, in Thy clemency, hear and answer me.</description>

      <description>Taken directly from Jeannie Myers - https://www.biblestudytools.com/bible-study/topical-studies/calming-prayers-to-say-before-bed.html&#xA;Bedtime prayer can be a meaningful way to spend time with God every evening, talking over your day, sharing your concerns with Him, and thanking Him for His love and care. But why should we take time to pray before bed each night?&#xA;Praying as you fall asleep gives you the chance to look back over the day and thank God for His help and His blessings.</description>

I give you heartfelt thanks for all the love and goodness you show them. At some future day I shall, with thanks more worthy than I can now give, repay your care for them, and before the whole heavenly court acknowledge their indebtedness to your guidance and protection.</description>
