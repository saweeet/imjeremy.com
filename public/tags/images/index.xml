      <description>Background&#xD;Hitting the 20GB limit that Google provides for all your email and photos was inevitable. When that time came, I started digging around and found two potential solutions:&#xA;Immich Photoprism I tried both, and honestly, they work really well. However, I decided to go with Immich since so many users were raving about how awesome it is.&#xA;My Current Setup&#xD;Raspberry Pi 4 (Rpi4) with a 512GB SanDisk NAS Docker I won&amp;rsquo;t go into detail about how to set everything up because that&amp;rsquo;s already covered in the Immich installation guide.</description>

      <description>Background&#xD;Important Update&#xA;In a recent X Post, it is seems like Real Debrid (RD) they&amp;rsquo;re slowly their content and service may stop working. However, instead of RD, we can use Torguard directly with Stremio.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m planning to continue using RD until my subscription runs out and/or until the service stops working.&#xA;A friend told me about a new way to stream 4k media content for roughly $3-5 per month, depending on the subscription you choose.</description>
