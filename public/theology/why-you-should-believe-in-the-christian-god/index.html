        <p>For me, this has got to be one of, if not the most important question someone can ever ask. I mean, we&rsquo;re talking about eternal salvation here. When the time comes when we take our final breaths, we will be basking in enteral paradise with Him, or we will find out there&rsquo;s really nothing out there.</p>
<p>My personal reasoning as to why I believe has changed progressively over the years and evolved in many ways. I&rsquo;ve divided my thoughts into two sections, quick thoughts and longer ones. The first being my initial thoughts when conversing on this topic. The longer ones for a deep dive.</p>

<h2 id="quick-thoughts" class="anchor-link"><a href="#quick-thoughts">Quick Thoughts</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>It is unlikely that there will be a single convincing answer to prove God&rsquo;s existence, rather it will be a combination of reasons.</li>
<li>God is immaterial, so we cannot use standard material scientific approaches.</li>
<li>We need to identify our emotional bias. We need to be aware that we are emotionally persuaded in one way or another. We should discern whether those who are in engaged in discussion are in a healthy mindset to critically think about the reasoning put forward from both parties.</li>
<li>Why is God even important to us. Perhaps some of us don&rsquo;t want him to be real since we may think all the &lsquo;fun&rsquo; will be out of reach, and even be cast out by society.</li>
<li>Jesus Christ is the only religious figure that claimed to be divine, other religions have messengers <em>from</em> God, not <em>is</em> God themselves.</li>
<li>Much convincing evidence are from testimonials given from others we trust such as, scholars, friends or loved ones.</li>
<li>The bible is a reliable source of truth. The majority of reputable historians and archaeologist use the Bible as a trustworthy source.</li>
<li>To be convinced is an individual journey. One must desire to look for answers, rather expecting to be forced to believe.</li>
<li>Often we speak of probability or the likelihood that this something is real or going to happen. Ultimately, there will always be the question &ldquo;what if&rdquo;, a gap of the unknown that no amount of science would ever be able to prove. This also doesn&rsquo;t mean we cannot be 100% convinced.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="and-longer-ones" class="anchor-link"><a href="#and-longer-ones">And longer ones.</a></h2>
<p>Many are looking for a single proof, a one answer that explains all. I&rsquo;ve listened to many debates and Catholic Apologetics, often it is said that God&rsquo;s existence cannot be determined by traditional scientific methods. Traditional, meaning where we analyze and observe material things under a telescope. This is because God is <em>immaterial</em>, and thus, we need to look to other methods to determine his existence.  For example, we should look at the truths we already know and use it as evidence to support our claims.</p>
<p>I feel many friends would be open to the likelihood of God and even be convinced by many arguments. After all, the idea of loving God who wants to grant you with abundance of gifts, virtues, love, then eternity in paradise together with loved ones sounds very bliss. In fact, God created us to desire Him. At the root of all of our desires now, can God alone only provide. However, many will not pursue this idea due to social constructs, Chrstian rules and fear that they will not be able to have <em>fun</em> or even outcasted from society. Consequently, these types of people rather turn a blind eye, hoping for ignorant is bliss way of life, fearing it will lock them in whereas in reality, it is the commplete reverse: the truth will set you free.</p>
<p>Often I see those who are angry with religions groups will shout the loudest, and so can sympathise who would ever want to be on the harsh receiving end. These people are often hurt. So we also need to be able to think logically about the claims and reasoning the apologetics put forward. That is, we should be aware of any emotional or biased thoughts that may be persuading one belief over another. It is important to question oneself, why is it important to believe in God. After all, if we don&rsquo;t want to be convinced or if our mind and hearts are not prepared to receive Him, then it is most likely that all the reasoning that this world could possibly ever offer will not be sufficed.</p>
<p>There are many reasons and arguments for the existence of God.  Some reasons can be deep and philosophical, such as Thomas Aquinas&rsquo; five ways [1]. Others might be that the teachings and fruits produced by Catholicism are all aligned to something greater than ourselves [2]. I&rsquo;m no theologian, so I can only share my own simple reasoning for God&rsquo;s existence that resonated with me.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Jesus Christ was a real person who walked this Earth and claimed to be God</strong>. No other major religion figure has claim to do so. Many other religious figures say they&rsquo;re messengers or alike, none other Jesus Christ say that he is divine himself. Any reputable historian or archaeologist have used the Bible as trustworthy and agreed that he existed and died by crucifixion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I would say the biggest hurdle to believe in, is the resurrection. Saint Paul would say, without the resurrection, then our Faith is <em>useless</em> and that we Christians are <em>the most pitiful of people</em> [1 Corithians 15:12-19]. The evidence for the resurrection is surprisingly very convincing, and it is up to you to put the effort in and seek this out. Many debates are online on this topic, a recent one is by the truly respected Trent Horn git Matt Dillahunty [3].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Apostles endured horrendous deaths. Many other groups often renounce their faith when attacked with death or horrible torture. This indicates that the Apostles and early Christians really believed that Jesus truly resurrected. How does this differ to other religions who die in the name of their faith</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Saint Paul, was who formally a Roman commander who publicly persecuted Christians, had a complete 180 degree conversion. This miracle conversion, in Acts 9:1-19, lead Saint Paul to became one of Catholicism greatest Saint. What an amazing testimonial that one of Roman&rsquo;s high officials suddenly became one of Catholicism the biggest saints [5]. I cannot think of any other reason as to why Saint Paul would risk his high reputation, torture and status other than if the conversion story was true.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The saints and their stories of Miracles is just so nice to hear, sometimes difficult to believe! The fact they were real people too, ready to die, be tortured etc showed a genuine act of faith. That is, that they really believe in what they preached. Considering the vast quantity of saints and their stories, it’s quite overwhelming that it becomes convincing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The thought of something had to start somewhere. Atoms, materials etc, all had an origin. So if we keep going to ‘where did that come from’, it would naturally lead to a great super being, ie God. But what made God ? Well, good question. Let&rsquo;s ask him when we get to Heaven.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He has answered prayers. And not just mine, but of many others as well. There are some prayers I’ve requested, and God has sometimes chosen no to answer immediately. Sometimes he answers at a later time, and He answers in abundance. Sure, he doesn’t always give me exactly the way I wanted. But reflecting on my prayer requests, he has given more than I can ever ask for. I believe all things are permitted to happen so that it can bring a greater good.</p>
