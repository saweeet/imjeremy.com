<p>Wow, big question right ? My understanding has changed progressively over the years and evolved in many ways.</p>
<p>There several reasons as to why I believe in a God. In no particular order, here are my reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Jesus Christ, a real person who walked this Earth and claimed to be God. The evidence that shows he existed, died and resurrected is very convincing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The thought of something had to start somewhere. Atoms, materials etc, all had had an origin. So if we keep going to ‘where did that come from’, it would naturally lead to a great super being, ie God. But what made God ? That’s an answer for another post.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He has answered my prayers. There are some prayers I’ve requested, and God has always answered in abundance. Sure, he doesn’t always give me exactly the way I wanted. But reflecting he has given more that I can ever asked for.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The saints and their stories of Miracles is just so nice to hear, sometimes difficult to believe! The fact they were real people too, and was ready to die, be tortured etc meant they really believe in what they said. Include the vast quantity of stories, it’s quite overwhelming that it becomes convincing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
