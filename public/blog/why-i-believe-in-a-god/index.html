    <p>Big question right. My reasonining has changed progressively over the years and evolved in many ways. And so I&rsquo;ve tried to divide my thoughts into two sections, quick thoughts and longer ones.</p>

<h2 id="quick-thoughts" class="anchor-link"><a href="#quick-thoughts">Quick Thoughts</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>It is unlikely that there will be a single convincing answer to prove God&rsquo;s exisitence, rather it will be a combination of reasons.</li>
<li>God is immaterial, so we need to reach examine this using non-material scientific approaches.</li>
<li>Are we able in a healthy mindset to critically think about the reasoning put forward, or are we emotionally persuaded in one way or another.</li>
<li>Why is God even important to us. Perhaps some of us don&rsquo;t want him to be real since we think we won&rsquo;t be able to have all the &lsquo;fun&rsquo; and will be cast out by society.</li>
<li>Jesus Christ is the only religious figure that claimed to be divine</li>
<li>Many convincing evidence are from testomonials, that is given from others we trust, scholars, friends or loved ones.</li>
<li>The bible is be a reliable source of truth. Majority reputable historians and archaolgoist use the Bible as a trustworthy source.</li>
<li>To be convinced is an indidual journey. One must desire to look for answers, rather expecting to be forced to beleive.</li>
<li>Often we speak of probability or the likelihood that this something is real or going to happen. Ultimately, there will always be the question &ldquo;what if&rdquo;, a gap of the unknown that no amount of science would ever be able to prove. This doesn&rsquo;t mean we cannot be 100% convinced.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="and-longer-ones" class="anchor-link"><a href="#and-longer-ones">And longer ones.</a></h2>
<p>Many are looking for prove and a one answer that explains all.  I feel many of my friends would be open to the likelihood of God and be convinced, however will not persue it since they fear that they will not be able to have <em>fun</em> and even outcasted from society. Consequently they rather not look into the signs fearing it will lock them in. In the end, those who are angry with the relgions groups will shout the loudest, and who would ever want to be on the receiving end.</p>
<p>Often it is combination of many different reasons as to why we belive in a God. When discussing such topics we need to keep in mind that the existence of God cannot be determined by the traditional scientific method. This is where we analyze and observe material things under a telescope. Because God is <em>inmaterial</em>, we need look to other methods to determine his exisitence.</p>
<p>We also need to be able to think logically about the claims and reasoning the apologetics put forward. That is, we should be aware of any emotional or biased thoughts that may be persuading one belief over another.</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t done so already, I would invite you to read why is it important to believe in an God. After all, if we don&rsquo;t want to be convinced, or if our mind and hearts are not prepared to receive Him, then we will most likely throw all the reasoning that this world could possibly ever offer.</p>
<p>With no particular order, my reasons are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jesus Christ was a real person who walked this Earth. He claimed to be God, which is a big deal since no other religion figure has claim to do so. Many other religious figures say they&rsquo;re messengers or alike, none other Jesus Christ say that he is divine himself. Any reputable historian or archaelogist will have ample evidence that indicated he existed and died.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Okay, so we&rsquo;re convinced that Jesus Christ was a real person, but what evidence is there that he is Divine ?</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The true strrugle is to believe in, the resurrection. I have heard from scholars that without the resurrection, Christianity would fall apart and Chrstians would be complete fools! However, the evidence for the resurrection is suprisingly very convincing. Today we can obtain the evidence we would expect from such a event.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Apostles endured horrendous deaths. Many other groups often renounce their faith when attacked with death or horrible torture. I can only believe that the Apostles and early Christians really believed that Jesus truly resurrected. How does this differ to other religions who die in the name of their faith ?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Saint Paul, was who formally a Roman commander who persecuted Christians did a complete 180 degree. After a miracle conversion Acts 9:1-19, he became one the Catholics greatest Saint. For the historical evidence that supports his story is convincing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The thought of something had to start somewhere. Atoms, materials etc, all had had an origin. So if we keep going to ‘where did that come from’, it would naturally lead to a great super being, ie God. But what made God ? Well, good question. Let&rsquo;s ask him when we get to Heaven.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He has answered prayers. And not just mine, but of many others as well. There are some prayers I’ve requested, and God has sometimes answered in abundance. Sure, he doesn’t always give me exactly the way I wanted. But reflecting he has given more that I can ever asked for. I believe all things are permitted to happen so that it can bring a greater good.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="../images/20220530163406.png" alt="20220530163406.png"></p>
<ul>
<li>The saints and their stories of Miracles is just so nice to hear, sometimes difficult to believe! The fact they were real people too, and was ready to die, be tortured etc meant they really believe in what they said. Include the vast quantity of stories, it’s quite overwhelming that it becomes convincing.</li>
</ul>
